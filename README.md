# Flash Cards
Flash Cards is a front-end application that allows users to create and manage their own flashcards. Users can add questions and answers with category, 
which are displayed on double-sided cards. Users can click on a card to flip it over and reveal the answer. Users can also delete and edit their cards, 
and all changes are saved to local storage.
